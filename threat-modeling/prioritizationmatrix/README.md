# Prioritization Matrix

This directory contains the **Prioritization Matrix** used for threat modeling and risk assessment for the Canvoy project. The goal of this matrix is to categorize and prioritize identified threats to ensure resources are allocated efficiently for mitigation.

## Contents

- **Canvoy Threat Model - Do Later**: A list of potential threats that should be addressed in the future. These are threats that have lower priority or can be monitored over time.
- **Canvoy Threat Model - Do Next**: A set of immediate threats that need to be addressed soon. These threats are a higher priority and should be tackled based on their potential impact and likelihood.
- **Canvoy Threat Model - Do Now**: Critical threats that need immediate action. These represent the highest priority threats to the security and functionality of the system.
- **README.md**: An overview of the prioritization matrix, how to use it, and guidelines for assessing threats and applying mitigations.

## Overview

The **Prioritization Matrix** is essential for effectively managing the security threats identified in the Canvoy project. By categorizing threats into "Do Now," "Do Next," and "Do Later," this matrix allows the security team to focus efforts on the most critical areas, ensuring proactive risk management.

### Categories in the Matrix:

- **Do Now**: Immediate actions required to address critical threats.
- **Do Next**: Next steps to address important threats that should not be ignored but can be handled after the "Do Now" actions.
- **Do Later**: Threats that should be monitored but are not urgent at this moment.

## Files:

### 1. **Canvoy_Threat_Model_DoLater.md**
A markdown file containing low-priority threats that should be addressed later, but not forgotten. These could include threats with low likelihood or minor impact.

### 2. **Canvoy_Threat_Model_DoNext.md**
A markdown file containing medium-priority threats that need to be handled soon. These could include potential vulnerabilities that need fixing but arenâ€™t an immediate risk.

### 3. **Canvoy_Threat_Model_DoNow.md**
A markdown file that highlights the critical threats that require immediate attention. This includes high-impact vulnerabilities that need to be mitigated as soon as possible to ensure the safety and stability of the system.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Threats**: Start by reviewing the **Do Now** threats. These require the most urgent attention.
2. **Prioritize**: Once the immediate threats are addressed, move on to the **Do Next** category, and finally to **Do Later** as time and resources permit.
3. **Implement Mitigations**: Apply the necessary security controls and mitigation strategies to address the threats in each category.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure threats are categorized correctly based on current impact assessments and security priorities.
- Regularly update the threat models as new threats are discovered or existing ones evolve.
- When contributing to the threat models, follow best practices for risk assessment and ensure thorough documentation for each identified threat.

## Additional Notes

This directory is a part of the broader **Threat Modeling** efforts to assess and mitigate security risks for the Canvoy project. Ensure all team members are familiar with the structure of the prioritization matrix for effective collaboration and risk management.
